## Credits
Of course, thanks to Microsoft for coming up with Microsoft Agent and making the Peedy character, which is used in OpenAgent.

Thanks to Dorkbox for making his awesome System Tray (https://github.com/dorkbox/systemtray), which I used for the system tray icon.

Thanks to Tetyys for making the Online Microsoft Sam TTS generator (https://tetyys.com/SAPI4/), which I used for the SAPI4 voice.

Thanks to the creators of MaryTTS for making it (https://github.com/marytts/marytts), which I used as the main TTS engine.

Thanks to Pierre David Belanger for making the Chatter Bot API (https://github.com/pierredavidbelanger/chatter-bot-api), which I used for the chat in JBuddy, the example program for OpenAgent.

Thanks to this website (https://www.care.com/c/stories/3776/101-funny-jokes-for-kids/) for making the jokes I used in JBuddy.

Thanks to Carnegie Mellon University for making the voice for MaryTTS, and for making Sphinx4 (https://cmusphinx.github.io/).
