# OpenAgent
An open-source, cross-platform replacement for Microsoft Agent written in Java.

## Installation
Check the wiki tab for instructions on getting OpenAgent up and running.

## Running
First of all, make sure you have Java installed; it doesn't matter whether it's the JRE or the JDK.

Download the repo. Open the repo folder, then the "jars" folder, then the "test" folder. Double-click on the jbuddy.jar file. If that doesn't work, follow these steps for your operating system and file manager below:
### Windows & Windows Explorer
Hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd>, and right-click. Click "Open command window here" or "Open PowerShell window here", whichever comes up. When it comes up, type `java -jar jbuddy.jar`.

### Linux
#### Nautilus / Thunar
Right-click in the folder, and click "Open terminal here". Type `java -jar jbuddy.jar`.

#### Dolphin
Press <kbd>F4</kbd> in the folder, and type `java -jar jbuddy.jar`.

#### No file manager / other file manager
Open a terminal emulator, and `cd` to the above folder. Type `java -jar jbuddy.jar`.
